This is probably due to the fact that when we know nothing about the environment - we are likely to get trapped into bad states, water or wolf. As we learn more and start using this knowledge, we can explore the environment for longer, but we still do not know well where apples are.\n",

This indicates stochastic nature of the process, and that we can at some point \"sploil\" the Q-Table coefficients, by overwriting them with new values. This ideally should be minimized by decreasing learning rate (i.e. towards the end of training we only adjust Q-Table values by a small value).\n",

The process of finding best hyperparameter values is called **hyperparameter optimization**, and it deserves a separate topic."
